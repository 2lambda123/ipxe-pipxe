# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently no version is supported with security updates, since this project is
in a very early development stage. Nonetheless, the project is updated if
changes in its dependencies occur.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are extremely grateful for anyone that report vulnerabilities to the piPXE
Open Source Community. All reports are thoroughly investigated by a set of
community volunteers.

To make a report, submit your vulnerability as a new issue or pull request. Make
sure to choose the `security` label for your issue or PR.
